# PL-RandomForest

I am currently a student of Computer science, I am following the machine learning course, and for my final exam of the course I decided to develop this simple algorithm that uses the RandomForest technique to predict the football matches in the Premier League. 

The algorithm after reading a DataSet I found here on GitHub ( for the 2021-2022 Season ) will be divided into Train and Test part, and with a first look the algorithm will fix and normalize all the data, so that the algorithm can work with numerical values only.

I managed to develop the very basic of the algorithm until now, I aim to increase the precision of my algorithm so that the prediction would be more correct.

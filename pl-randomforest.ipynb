the model**\n","\n","As soon as our basic predictors are created and added to the DataSet, we are able to Train our model.

The algorithm determines the importance of each predictor by measuring how much it contributes to reducing the impurity or increasing the information gain in the decision tree.\n","\n","When making predictions with the trained Random Forest model, the algorithm combines the predictions of all the decision trees by averaging (for regression problems) or voting (for classification problems) to generate the final prediction. Each decision tree contributes its own prediction based on the assigned subset of predictors, and the final prediction is determined by the collective wisdom of the entire ensemble.\n","\n","In summary, predictors in the Random Forest algorithm are the input variables that capture the relevant information and characteristics of the data used to train the model. These predictors are used by individual decision trees within the ensemble to make predictions, and the algorithm combines the predictions of all the decision trees to produce the final prediction."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8,"id":"1b9fab1b","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-18T01:19:09.442112Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-18T01:19:09.441466Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-18T01:19:12.343067Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-18T01:19:12.342255Z"},"papermill":{"duration":2.912301,"end_time":"2023-10-18T01:19:12.345214","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-10-18T01:19:09.432913","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<style>#sk-container-id-1 {color: black;background-color: white;}#sk-container-id-1 pre{padding: 0;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-toggleable {background-color: white;}#sk-container-id-1 label.sk-toggleable__label {cursor: pointer;display: block;width: 100%;margin-bottom: 0;padding: 0.3em;box-sizing: border-box;text-align: center;}#sk-container-id-1 label.sk-toggleable__label-arrow:before {content: \"▸\";float: left;margin-right: 0.25em;color: #696969;}#sk-container-id-1 label.sk-toggleable__label-arrow:hover:before {color: black;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-estimator:hover label.sk-toggleable__label-arrow:before {color: black;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-toggleable__content {max-height: 0;max-width: 0;overflow: hidden;text-align: left;background-color: #f0f8ff;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-toggleable__content pre {margin: 0.2em;color: black;border-radius: 0.25em;background-color: #f0f8ff;}#sk-container-id-1 input.sk-toggleable__control:checked~div.sk-toggleable__content {max-height: 200px;max-width: 100%;overflow: auto;}#sk-container-id-1 input.sk-toggleable__control:checked~label.sk-toggleable__label-arrow:before {content: \"▾\";}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-estimator input.sk-toggleable__control:checked~label.sk-toggleable__label {background-color: #d4ebff;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-label input.sk-toggleable__control:checked~label.sk-toggleable__label {background-color: #d4ebff;}#sk-container-id-1 input.sk-hidden--visually {border: 0;clip: rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);height: 1px;margin: -1px;overflow: hidden;padding: 0;position: absolute;width: 1px;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-estimator {font-family: monospace;background-color: #f0f8ff;border: 1px dotted black;border-radius: 0.25em;box-sizing: border-box;margin-bottom: 0.5em;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-estimator:hover {background-color: #d4ebff;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-parallel-item::after {content: \"\";width: 100%;border-bottom: 1px solid gray;flex-grow: 1;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-label:hover label.sk-toggleable__label {background-color: #d4ebff;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-serial::before {content: \"\";position: absolute;border-left: 1px solid gray;box-sizing: border-box;top: 0;bottom: 0;left: 50%;z-index: 0;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-serial {display: flex;flex-direction: column;align-items: center;background-color: white;padding-right: 0.2em;padding-left: 0.2em;position: relative;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-item {position: relative;z-index: 1;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-parallel {display: flex;align-items: stretch;justify-content: center;background-color: white;position: relative;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-item::before, #sk-container-id-1 div.sk-parallel-item::before {content: \"\";position: absolute;border-left: 1px solid gray;box-sizing: border-box;top: 0;bottom: 0;left: 50%;z-index: -1;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-parallel-item {display: flex;flex-direction: column;z-index: 1;position: relative;background-color: white;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-parallel-item:first-child::after {align-self: flex-end;width: 50%;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-parallel-item:last-child::after {align-self: flex-start;width: 50%;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-parallel-item:only-child::after {width: 0;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-dashed-wrapped {border: 1px dashed gray;margin: 0 0.4em 0.5em 0.4em;box-sizing: border-box;padding-bottom: 0.4em;background-color: white;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-label label {font-family: monospace;font-weight: bold;display: inline-block;line-height: 1.2em;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-label-container {text-align: center;}#sk-container-id-1 div.sk-container {/* jupyter's `normalize.less` sets `[hidden] { display: none; }` but bootstrap.min.css set `[hidden] { display: none !important; }` so we also need the `!important` here to be able to override the default hidden behavior on the sphinx rendered scikit-learn.org.

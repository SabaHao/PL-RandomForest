In order to increase the accuracy these predictors might include team statistics (e.g., previous match results, goal difference, number of goals scored), player performance metrics (e.g., goals, assists, yellow cards), historical data (e.g., head-to-head records, past performance in similar scenarios), and various other factors that might influence the outcome of a match.\n",

Each decision tree in the Random Forest is built using a different subset of the available predictors. This process is known as \"feature bagging\" or \"feature sampling.\" By considering different subsets of predictors for each tree, the Random Forest algorithm reduces the correlation between individual trees and ensures a diverse set of predictions."
